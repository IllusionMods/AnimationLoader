# AnimationLoader
A plugin for loading animations from Sideloader zipmods.  
Thank you Essu for the [main bulk of the code](https://github.com/IllusionMods/AnimationLoader/commit/402c02af3bbb5a6e1b3015bd0caa3f0a7db618fc)  
See the [template](template.xml) for how to configure animations in your own mod.

2. Download the latest release from [the releases page](../../releases)
3. Drop the dll to `bepinex/plugins`
4. Add animation packages to the mods folder. (These can usually be downloaded with KKManager)
